## ✨ Project Overview
[cite_start]This project is a successful implementation of a web-based weather application, developed as a mini-project for the Master of Computer Applications (MCA) degree[cite: 10, 11]. [cite_start]It is designed to fetch and display real-time weather parameters (temperature and humidity) for any location worldwide[cite: 86, 409].

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* [cite_start]**HTML:** For the foundational structure of the web page[cite: 62].
* [cite_start]**CSS:** For styling and layout (look and presentation)[cite: 73, 140, 141].
* [cite_start]**JavaScript:** For interactivity, handling user input, and connecting to the API[cite: 96, 147].
* [cite_start]**OpenWeatherMap API:** The external service used to access current, real-time weather data[cite: 57, 152, 162].

## 📝 Key Features
* [cite_start]**Real-Time Data:** Accesses server data via an API key to display the current temperature and humidity for any city entered[cite: 57, 409].
* [cite_start]**API Integration:** Demonstrates knowledge of using the browser's built-in `fetch` functionality to extract and process JSON data from a third-party service[cite: 88, 91].
* [cite_start]**Core Development:** Built entirely using fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)[cite: 57].
* [cite_start]**Simple UI:** Provides a clean, color-coded interface for displaying the results[cite: 316, 317].

## 🔑 Setup & Running the Project Locally

**Note:** The API key has been intentionally removed from the public code as a security best practice.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/akshaycontact-afk/weather-forecast-app.git](https://github.com/akshaycontact-afk/weather-forecast-app.git)
    ```
2.  [cite_start]**Get an API Key:** Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to obtain your unique API key[cite: 211, 268].
3.  **Insert Key:** Open the `script.js` file and replace the placeholder value for `API_KEY` with your actual key.
4.  **Launch:** Open `index.html` in your web browser or use the VS Code Live Server extension to run the application.

## 🚀 Future Work (As Planned in Report)
The project aims to be expanded in the future by:
* [cite_start]Improving the design by giving more stylish themes and fonts[cite: 404].
* [cite_start]Comparing the API data with a weather predictor that forecasts weather based on past 5 years of data[cite: 405].
